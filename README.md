Simulation of the Stochastic Becker-DÃ¶ring equations

This code is design to simulate the Stochastic Becker-Doring model.
It is a continuous time Markov chain whose generator and mathematical properties are
discribed in http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5025
The algortihm is based on the Next reaction method presented in the paper:
    Efficient Exact Stochastic Simulation of Chemical Systems with Many Species and Many Channels
    Michael A. Gibson and and Jehoshua Bruck
    The Journal of Physical Chemistry A 2000 104 (9), 1876-1889
    DOI: 10.1021/jp993732q
 
The code needs is written in Python 2.7  (http://www.python.org/) and use matplotlib (www.matplotlib.org) 

To use the program just launch python example.py in the directory with soure files.

It has been writting by E. Hingant and R. Yvinec between 2013 and 2016.
